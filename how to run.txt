Run fix fonts:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\fix-fonts.ps1



How to run prune users:

Dry-run first (no deletion):

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
.\prune-users.ps1 -TargetOU "OU=CrewA,DC=example,DC=com"
# Inspect the CSV output carefully


Verify the list manually (especially for accounts you recognize). 
Use Get-ADUser -Identity <sAM> to inspect any suspicious entries.

Perform deletion only after manual review:

.\prune-users.ps1 -TargetOU "OU=CrewA,DC=example,DC=com" -PerformDeletion
# Then type CONFIRM DELETE to proceed
